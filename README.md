# TheMines

In anticipation for the upcoming Minecraft 1.18 Caves and Cliffs: Part 2 update, I've seen a lot of people building cliffs in their worlds, but they seem to have forgotten about the latter part of the update: the cliffs. I am going to fix that with this mod which will not only turn your entire world into a giant cave, but it'll also add a few new tools and items to make your new digging life a little bit easier.

This mod adds new items such as the "World Shakers" which are like pickaxes, but can mine 3x3 areas, and some enchantments for them which make them mine an even larger area.

## Building

> ### **Dependencies**:
>
> Java 16 or greater
> Fabric API

1. Download the source code
2. Unzip the files if needed and navigate to the directory with this README.md
3. Open a terminal and type in `./gradlew build` on mac or linux, or `.\gradlew.bat build` on windows
4. Navigate to the `build/libs` directory and there should be 2 jars, one with `-dev` towards the end, and one without, put the one without in your minecraft mods directory
