In anticipation for the upcoming Minecraft 1.18 Caves and Cliffs: Part 2 update, I've seen a lot of people building cliffs in their worlds, but they seem to have forgotten about the latter part of the update: the cliffs. I am going to fix that with this mod which will not only turn your entire world into a giant cave, but it'll also add a few new tools and items to make your new digging life a little bit easier.
